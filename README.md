Explanation

1. Importing Libraries: We import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.


2. Loading the Dataset: We load the house price dataset into a DataFrame and inspect it.


3. EDA: We explore the dataset for missing values and correlations between variables.


4. Feature Selection: We select the relevant features for our model.


5. Train-Test Split: We split the data into training and test sets to prevent overfitting.


6. Training the Model: We fit a linear regression model on the training data.


7. Making Predictions: We use the trained model to predict house prices on the test set.


8. Evaluating the Model: We calculate MSE and RÂ² score to assess performance.


9. Visualizing Results: We plot actual vs predicted prices to visually assess model performance.



This completes the task of building and evaluating a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Let me know if you need further clarification or additional functionality!
